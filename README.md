# Deskmode Switcher 1.1
 Switch between Darkmode and Lightmode in iBuntu Version 1 and Version 3

### Important
iBuntu is a flavor of Ubuntu LTS


This program is just a shell-script whith a desktop-application which allows the user to switch with one click pre-setted themes for GTK3, the User-Shell-Theme, Background-Picture and Plank-themes

Because it's complete integrated within iBuntu i won't explain how to customize it. Everybody who is interested can download and experiment with it as he wishes - beside this, the code is documentation enough ;-)


So long
